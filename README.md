# POS Multiple E-Wallet
 Company Hitachi is developing a Payment Integration Platform that allows merchants to
connect Point-of-Sale (POS) systems with multiple e-wallet providers (GoPay, OVO,
Dana, ShopeePay). Merchants will use the API to:  
1. Authenticate securely.
2. Retrieve available e-wallet channels.
3. Create a payment request.
4. Check transaction status.
5. Handle refund requests 
The API uses Bearer Token authentication and returns responses in JSON format.
